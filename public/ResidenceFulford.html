<h1 class="roleDescription">
        Résidence Fulford prides itself on providing a high quality service and caring environment for senior women.

        It is a private non-for profit residence, administered by a volunteer board of directors. 
    
        One of Fulford’s many strengths is the extent of its volunteer support which contributes to the services
    
        the ladies can enjoy. We are now looking for volunteer French and English 
    
        students. Please reach out for more information.
