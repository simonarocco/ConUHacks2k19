<p>Résidence Fulford prides itself on providing a high quality service and caring environment for senior women.
    <br>It is a private non-for profit residence, administered by a volunteer board of directors. 
    <br>One of Fulford’s many strengths is the extent of its volunteer support which contributes to the services
    <br>the ladies can enjoy. We are now looking for volunteer French and English 
    students. Please reach out for more information.</p>
