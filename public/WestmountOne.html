<h1 class="roleDescription">
    From the elegant lobby to the most subtle security features, Westmount One perfects the notion 

    of "worry free surroundings". Designed by a team of architects, designers and planners 

    seasoned in senior living, this sophisticated apartment complex only awaits each residentâ€™s 

    personal touch and furnishings. We are now looking for volunteer French and English 

    students to help out.
