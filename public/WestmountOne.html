<p>From the elegant lobby to the most subtle security features, Westmount One perfects the notion 
    <br>of "worry free surroundings". Designed by a team of architects, designers and planners 
    <br>seasoned in senior living, this sophisticated apartment complex only awaits each residentâ€™s 
    <br>personal touch and furnishings. We are now looking for volunteer French and English 
    students to help out.</p>
