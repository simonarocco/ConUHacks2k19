        We are a hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Located on Sherbrooke Street East in the

        borough of Ville-Marie, across from La Fontaine Park. We were first established in 1880, and 
    
        has been at its present site since 1924. We are now looking for French and English students
    
        to volunteer and help out in the hospital, and get to know each other.
