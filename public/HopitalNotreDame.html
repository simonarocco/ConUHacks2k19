<p>We are a hospital in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. We ar located on Sherbrooke Street East in the
    <br> borough of Ville-Marie, across from La Fontaine Park. We were first established in 1880, and 
     <br>has been at its present site since 1924. We are now looking for French and English students
    <br>to volunteer and help out in the hospital, and get to know each other</p>
